Program-1 Printing of a Matrix
Explanation with theory of the code : This C++ program demonstrates how to create and display a 2D matrix using user input. It begins by prompting the user to enter the number of rows and columns, then declares a fixed-size matrix capable of storing up to 56 rows and 46 columns. Using nested loops, it collects individual elements for each cell of the matrix and stores them accordingly. After input, the program prints the matrix in a structured format, row by row. It showcases fundamental concepts like arrays, loops, and input/output operations.

Algorithm:

Start
Declare variables: a, b, and a 2D array matrix[56][46]
Prompt the user to enter the number of rows and read a
Prompt the user to enter the number of columns and read b
Use nested loops to input each element of the matrix
Use nested loops to display the matrix in row-column format
End
Program-2 Addition of two matrix
Explanation and theory of the code : This C++ program performs matrix addition for two user-defined matrices of size a × b. It uses 2D arrays, nested loops, and basic input/output operations to read, store, and compute the sum of corresponding elements from two matrices. Matrix addition is only valid when both matrices have the same dimensions. If C and D are two matrices of size a × b, their sum S is also a matrix of size a × b, where each element is calculated as: S[i][j] = C[i][j] + D[i][j]

Algorithm:

Start
Declare variables a, b, and 2D arrays c[100][100], d[100][100], s[100][100]
Prompt the user to enter the number of rows and read a
Prompt the user to enter the number of columns and read b

Prompt and read elements of the first matrix using nested loops
Display the first matrix
Prompt and read elements of the second matrix using nested loops
Display the second matrix
Add corresponding elements of both matrices and store in matrix s
Display the sum matrix
End
Program-3 Multiplication of two Matrix
Explanation and theory of the code: This C++ program performs matrix multiplication between two user-defined matrices. It first takes input for the dimensions of both matrices and checks if multiplication is valid by ensuring the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second. Using three nested loops, it calculates the product matrix by summing the products of corresponding elements. The result is stored in a third matrix and displayed in row-column format. Matrix multiplication follows the rule: if matrix A is of size a × b and matrix B is of size x × y, then the product matrix will be of size a × y, and each element is computed as the dot product of row i from A and column j from B.

Algorithm:

Start
Declare variables a, b, x, y for matrix dimensions
Prompt and read rows (a) and columns (b) of the first matrix
Prompt and read rows (x) and columns (y) of the second matrix
Check if b != x; if true, display "Invalid conditions" and stop
Declare matrices c[100][100], d[100][100], and p[100][100]
Prompt and read elements of the first matrix using nested loops
Prompt and read elements of the second matrix using nested loops
Initialize each element of product matrix p[i][j] to 0
Use three nested loops to compute matrix multiplication.
Display the product matrix p
End
Program-4 Addition of the diagonal elements
Explanation and theory of the code: This C++ program calculates the sum of both diagonals in a square matrix. The user inputs the matrix size n and its elements. The main diagonal includes elements where row and column indices are equal (matrix[i][i]), while the secondary diagonal includes elements where the column index is n - i - 1. Two variables a and b accumulate the sums of these diagonals. If the matrix size is odd, the center element lies on both diagonals and is counted twice. To correct this, the program subtracts the center element once from the total. This logic ensures accurate diagonal summation and demonstrates array traversal, conditional checks, and matrix indexing—essential concepts for handling 2D arrays and performing mathematical operations

Algorithm :

Start
Declare integer n for matrix size
Prompt and read n
Declare 2D array matrix[100][100] and variables a = 0, b = 0
Prompt and read matrix elements using nested loops
Display the matrix
Loop from i = 0 to n - 1
Display a and b matrices
Compute ds = a + b
If n is odd, subtract the center element matrix[n / 2][n / 2] once
Display adjusted diagonal sum ds
End
Program-5 Transpose of a Matrix
Explanation of the Code: This C++ program computes the transpose of a matrix. The user inputs the number of rows a and columns b, followed by the matrix elements. The original matrix is stored in matrix[a] [b], and its transpose is stored in transpose[b][a]. Transposing a matrix means converting its rows into columns and vice versa—i.e., transpose[j] [i] = matrix[i][j]. This operation is useful in linear algebra, image processing, and data transformations. The program displays both the original and transposed matrices, demonstrating nested loops, array manipulation, and dynamic indexing. It reinforces the concept of 2D arrays and how to systematically access and rearrange data structures in C++ for mathematical and logical operations.

Algorithm:

Start
Input rows a and columns b
Declare matrix[a][b] and transpose[b][a]
Input elements into matrix
Display original matrix
For each element matrix[i][j], set transpose[j][i] = matrix[i][j]
Display transpose
End
Conclusion:
Through these five programs, we explored the core operations on 2D arrays in C++, including matrix creation, display, addition, multiplication, diagonal summation, and transpose. Each program demonstrates the use of nested loops, array indexing, and conditional logic—essential tools for handling structured data. These implementations reinforce the theoretical understanding of matrices and their practical applications in fields like mathematics, computer graphics, and data science. By mastering these foundational concepts, learners build confidence in manipulating multi-dimensional data and solving complex problems efficiently using C++.
